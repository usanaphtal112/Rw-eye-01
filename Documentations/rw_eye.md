### **Project Documentation: Facial Expression and Face Recognition System**

---

#### **1. Project Overview**

This document provides a comprehensive guide to developing a **Facial Expression and Face Recognition System**. The system integrates with CCTV and other compatible cameras, enabling **real-time face detection**, **recognition**, and **facial expression analysis**. It features a responsive web dashboard designed for personal, institutional, and governmental use. Additionally, it fetches individual details from connected databases after recognition and can flag suspicious individuals with real-time alerts.

#### **2. Key Features**
1. **Face Detection**: Identify faces in live or recorded video streams.
2. **Face Recognition**: Match detected faces against a database of known individuals.
3. **Facial Expression Analysis**: Classify emotional states such as happiness, anger, or surprise.
4. **Suspicious Individual Alerts**: Identify and alert users to flagged individuals in real-time.
5. **Scalability**: Serve multiple institutions simultaneously with configurable features.
6. **User Dashboard**: A React-based web interface for managing and monitoring the system.
7. **Integration with CCTV**: Support for IP-based CCTV systems and other camera setups.
8. **Role-Based Access Control**: Different levels of access based on user roles and permissions.

#### **3. Technology Stack**

**Frontend**:  
- **React.js**: Create an interactive, dynamic, and responsive user interface.  
- **WebSocket**: For real-time data updates to the user dashboard.  

**Backend**:  
- **Django**: Provide a robust and scalable API server.  
- **Django Rest Framework**: Create secure, RESTful APIs for system functionality.  

**Machine Learning Models**:  
- **TensorFlow**: Power face detection, recognition, and expression analysis models.  
- **OpenCV**: Handle video and image preprocessing.  

**Database**:  
- **PostgreSQL**: Persistent storage for user profiles, face embeddings, and logs.  
- **Redis**: Enable caching and quick retrieval of temporary data.  

**Deployment**:  
- **Docker**: Containerize the application for portability and efficiency.  
- **Kubernetes**: (Optional) Orchestrate containerized deployment for scalability.

#### **4. System Architecture**
The system comprises:
1. **Frontend**: React-based web dashboard.
2. **Backend**: Django server with integrated ML models for face recognition and expression analysis.
3. **Databases**: PostgreSQL for persistent data and Redis for caching.
4. **Camera Integration**: IP-based camera feeds processed in real-time.
5. **Alert System**: Trigger notifications for flagged individuals.

#### **5. Component Interaction Flow**

1. **Video Stream Processing Flow**  
   This flow describes the steps for capturing, analyzing, and displaying live video streams.

    participant C as Camera
    participant VS as Video Stream Service
    participant FD as Face Detector
    participant FR as Face Recognizer
    participant EA as Expression Analyzer
    participant DB as Database
    participant RC as Redis Cache
    participant WS as WebSocket
    participant AS as Alert System

    C->>VS: Stream Video (RTSP)
    VS->>FD: Send Frames

    alt Recognition Only
        FD->>FR: Detect Faces
        FR->>DB: Fetch Known Individual Info
        FR->>RC: Cache Recognition Results
        FR->>WS: Send Real-Time Updates to Dashboard
    else Recognition and Expression Analysis
        FD->>FR: Detect Faces
        FR->>EA: Recognized Faces
        EA->>DB: Store Results (Recognition + Expression)
        EA->>RC: Cache Combined Results
        EA->>WS: Send Updates to Dashboard
    end

    opt Suspicious User Detected
        FR->>DB: Check Watchlist
        DB-->>FR: Suspicious User Found
        FR->>AS: Trigger Alert
        AS->>WS: Notify Dashboard with Alert
    end
```

2. **Authentication Flow**  
   This flow manages user access with role-based permissions.

```mermaid

    participant C as Client
    participant AG as API Gateway
    participant AS as Auth Service
    participant DB as Database
    participant RC as Redis Cache

    C->>AG: Request Access
    AG->>RC: Check Token in Cache

    alt Token Exists
        RC-->>AG: Valid Token
    else Token Missing
        AG->>AS: Validate Token
        AS->>DB: Fetch Roles and Permissions
        DB-->>AS: Return Permissions
        AS->>RC: Cache Token and Permissions
        AS-->>AG: Grant/Deny Access
    end

    alt Roles and Permissions
        opt Recognition Only
            AG-->>C: Access to Recognition API
        end
        opt Recognition + Expression Analysis
            AG-->>C: Access to Full System
        end
        opt Admin Role
            AG-->>C: Access Admin Dashboard and Alerts
        end
    end
```
